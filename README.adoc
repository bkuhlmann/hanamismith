= Hanamismith

Hanamismith is a Command Line Interface (CLI) for smithing Hanami projects. Perfect for when you need a professional and robust tool for building new project skeletons. To quote from the {dry_link} and {hanami_link} teams:
____
If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable Ruby applications, you're in for a treat. *Hanami is built for people like you*.

Whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer, *this learning process may still be hard*. Over time, we become used to certain things, and it can be painful to change. *But without change, there is no challenge* and without challenge, there is no growth.
____

Welcome to the modern age of web development! This gem will help you get up and running as quickly as possible. üöÄ

== Features

* Built atop {rubysmith_link} and leverages all features.
* Uses {dry_link} functional programming.
* Uses {hanami_link} for web application development.
* Uses {htmx_link} for proper REST (hypermedia) architectures (i.e. HTML over the wire) so you can write less code and avoid bloated JavaScript stacks.

The core functionality of this gem centers around the `--build` command and associated flags. The build options allow you to further customize the kind of gem you want to build. Most build options are enabled by default. For detailed documentation on all supported flags, see the link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/rubysmith/#_build[Rubysmith] documentation.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Use of the `--zeitwerk` or `--no-zeitwerk` flags will have no effect so you can ignore them since {hanami_link} builds in this functionality for you by default. At the moment, this flag is a carry over from the {rubysmith_link} project and will be removed in the future.

=== Configuration

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
$HOME/.config/hanamismith/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment
variables.

The default configuration is everything provided in the
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/rubysmith/#_configuration[Rubysmith].

Feel free to modify the default and save as your own custom `configuration.yml`. It is recommended that you provide common URLs for your project which would be all keys found in this section:

[source,yaml]
----
:project:
  :url:
    # Add sub-key values here.
----

When these values exist, you'll benefit from having this information added to your generated project documentation. Otherwise -- if these values are empty -- they are removed from new project generation entirely.

=== Workflows

When implementing and testing your project locally, a typical workflow might be:

[source,bash]
----
# Build new project
hanamismith --build demo

# Run code quality and test coverage checks
cd demo
bundle exec rake

# Develop (red, green, refactor)
bin/guard
git commit  # (repeat until finished with implementation)

# Run: With Overmind (recommended)
overmind start --port-step 10 --procfile Procfile.dev

# Run: Without Overmind
hanami server

# Deploy
git push
----

=== Aliases

For link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bash[Bash] users -- or other shell users -- you might find the following aliases helpful in reducing terminal keystrokes when using this gem:

[source,bash]
----
alias hsb="hanamismith --build"
alias hse="hanamismith --config edit"
alias hsh="hanamismith --help"
----

The above is what I use via my {dotfiles_link} project.

=== Demonstration

If you'd like a fully working demonstration application -- as built by this gem -- then check out the link:https://github.com/bkuhlmann/hemo[Hemo] project. Here's a quick screencast overview of demonstration application:
